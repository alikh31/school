### What does digital forensics means?

The main objective of digital world is to visualize all the aspect of the real world in the form of bit's and data, all the activities that previously has been manage by real persons now has been automatize by virtual services and devices. the mailing service that should have been done by an organization and numbers of individuals now can be managed by a service running on a server somewhere in the world.

This matter leads us to a new problem, the growing of the virtual crimes, the digital world has been connected to the real world in so many ways, so practically any fraud or crime inside it could be bounded in real life consequences. this gets us to the point where the is an essential need for observation of any possible miss use which might turn to the actual crime which would affect the real life.

To objectify any suspicious activity as a crime is a big part of resolving any problem in this field, one of the biggest issue is related to differentiate incidents and problems from actual miss uses. this means when a problems happens, for instance the server of a bank stops responding this could be ether due to an issue happened by a procedure running on that server or a potential attack to the server in order to get some information without the server supervision. no the problem remains to specify these two situation from each other.

Although the sample of a bank security is a potential situation that might happens but the problems inside digital world has a much bigger variety of problems such as, miss use of identification, publishing illegal content or even by passing taxing policies. what makes this whole progress much complicated is the different specialties needed to proceed and progress any case in digital forensic, from lawyers to computer specialists, this matter would get even more complicated while usually this groups have not much understanding from one another.

## How to do a forensics investigation?

The essential point following investigation of a case is to define a procedure that could end up into the specific conclusion. this procedure can be broken down into these phases: storing information, make a snapshot of gathered information, progress the snapshot for possible evidence, and prove that the snapshot that has the evidence is equivalent into the main information.

Storing information can be in form of simple log file up to monitoring resources for special environment. for instance when a server is running all the activities under that server is being monitored by special procedure and gathered as a log file, this log file would contain the users that access the server that income command and outcome command and procedure with resources that they've been using. or monitoring a network for special app in order to follow every package that has been send or receive by it.

Then for staring the investigation procedure a copy of that log file could be provided and keep in a different environment in order not to effect that original file. this copy has to be identical and has the ability to prove that it's identical. having the snapshot of the original log file no it's possible to investigate inside the copy and look for the possible corruption. this could be the most consuming phase as regularly the amount of information inside log files are huge and needs lots of effort and care to find the possible threat.
